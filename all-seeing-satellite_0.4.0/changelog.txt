Version: 0.4.0
Date: 20. 03. 2025
  Minor Features:
    - Figured out a way of basing minimum satellite launch threshold off of the magnitude (size) of a given planet
      Default is 3 (Nauvis); formula is:
      return_val = launch_threshold_setting * planet_magnitude * planet_magnitude
      if (planet_magnitude) < 1 then
      return_val = math.floor(return_val)
      else
      return_val = math.ceil(return_val)
      end
    - Works out to as follows for the vanilla planets:
      Fulgora: magnitude of 0.9 -> 2 satellites
      Nauvis: magnitude of 1 -> 3 satellites
      Aquilo: magnitude of 1 -> 3 satellites
      Gleba: magnitude of 1.1 -> 4 satellites
      Vulcanus: magnitude of 1.5 -> 7 satellites
    - Redid initialization/reinitialization, and then redid it again
    - Added configurable ('None' by default) logging levels
    - Added console commands:
      /all_seeing.init -> Initialize the supporting data structures from scratch, erasing any existing data
      /all_seeing.reinit -> Reinitialize the supporting data structures, making a moderate attempt to maintain existing data
      /all_seeing.print_storage -> Prints the contents or the supportings data structures
    - Support for additional modded planets. Should also properly detect vanilla planets now.
      Tested with Arrakis, and partially with Maraxsis
  Misc:
    - Updated base and space-age version requirements
    - Hotkey message is not displayed until rocket-silo is researched
      Disabling launch requirements will still allow the hotkey to be used

Version: 0.3.1
Date: 19. 03. 2025
  Bug fixes:
    - Corrected values/wording for settings and settings descriptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 18. 03. 2025
  Minor Features:
    - Satellites now expire after a given amount of time, default 20 minutes
    - Added configurable setting for the duration (in minutes) of a satellite in orbit, default 20 minutes
    - Quality satellites confer a longer life span of ~30% per tier
      normal    -> 20 * 1      = 20
      uncommon  -> 20 * 1.3    = 26
      rare      -> 20 * 1.69   = 33.8
      epic      -> 20 * 2.197  = 43.94
      legendary -> 20 * 2.8561 = 57.122
  Balance Changes:
    - Changed minimum launch threshold to be 3
      i.e. 3 satellites need to be in orbit simultaneously to toggle the FoW
  Misc:
    - Attempted to make minimum satellite launch threshold to be based on the size of the planet it was launched, but couldn't find a way to implement it (yet)

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 17. 03. 2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added satellite back as an item, recipe, and technology unlock (rocket silo research)
    - A rocket with a satellite in its inventory will automatically launch into orbit
    - Added setting to toggle satellite launch requirement
    - Added configurable setting for minimum satellite launch threshold for all planets to disable fog-of-war (0 - 100), default 1
  Misc:
    - Added a thumbnail

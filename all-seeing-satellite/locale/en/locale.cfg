all-seeing-satellite-require-satellites-in-orbit=Require satellites in orbit to toggle the FoW
all-seeing-satellite-restrict-satellite-scanning=Require satellites in orbit for scanning
all-seeing-satellite-restrict-satellite-mode=Require satellites in orbit for Satellite Mode
all-seeing-satellite-do-launch-rockets=Automatically launch rockets with satellites

all-seeing-satellite-track-satellites-launched-for-research=Track satellites launched for research

all-seeing-satellite-rocket-launch-delay=Rocket launch delay

all-seeing-satellite-default-satellite-time-to-live=How long will a satellite remain in orbit

all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold=Satellite launch threshold
all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold-modifier=Satellite launch threshold modifier

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-cooldown-duration=Satellite scan cooldown

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-mode=Satellite scan mode

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-base-quality-factor=Satellite base quality factor

all-seeing-satellite-nth-tick=Tick cycle time

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-mode-view-distance=Satellite mode view distance
all-seeing-satellite-satellite-mode-max-view-distance=Satellite mode max view distance

[mod-setting-description]
all-seeing-satellite-default-satellite-time-to-live=Time in minutes that a given satellite will last in orbit. Default of 20 minutes

all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold=Number of satellites required in orbit to toggle FoW or Satellite Mode. 0 to 100, default of 3 for planet with a magnitude of 1 (e.g Nauvis)
all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold-modifier=Ranges from [0-10], default of 1\n\nThe planet's satellite launch threshold is multiplied by this amount

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-cooldown-duration=Number of seconds before a satellite of normal quality can scan again

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-mode=queue: first-in-first-out, starts from the relative origin and works its way outwards to the edge\n\nstack: first-in-last-out, starts from the edge and works its way inward to the relative origin

all-seeing-satellite-do-launch-rockets=Whether to automatically try and launch a rocket that is set to manual, and loaded with a satellite, to orbit.

all-seeing-satellite-track-satellites-launched-for-research=If a rocket-silo launches a satellite, and has the "Send to orbit automatically" checkbox checked, whether to track that satellite and include it in "orbit".

all-seeing-satellite-rocket-launch-delay=Delay, in ticks (60 per second), between a satellite being loaded into a rocket-silo, and it subsequently being launched.\n\nThis is to give priority to rocket-silos set to automatically launch any cargo with launch products ("Send to orbit automatically" checkbox is checked).\n\nFrom testing, values less than 15 may preempt the default "Send to orbit automatically" mode behavior.

all-seeing-satellite-nth-tick=Default of 10\n\ni.e. will try to complete processing every 10 ticks before starting a new cycle\n\nSetting to 1 will cause it to try to process every tick.

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-mode-view-distance=From the Factorio mod api:\n\nThe number of game tiles across the horizontal axis at the game's default 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nhttps://lua-api.factorio.com/stable/concepts/ZoomSpecification.html
all-seeing-satellite-satellite-mode-max-view-distance=From the Factorio mod api:\n\nThe absolute maximum number of game tiles permitted along the window's longest axis...\n\nhttps://lua-api.factorio.com/stable/concepts/ZoomSpecification.html

Version: 0.7.1
Date: 2025-10-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - Added missing nil and '.valid' checks to the character-corpse entity when the player dies while in satellite mode
      - Only encountered this error once while testing another mod, and have not been able to recreate it since
      - The newly added checks should prevent it from occurring again though
  Misc:
    - Added configurable runtime settings for satellite mode view distance
      - Allows for changing how far out a player can zoom while in satellite mode (if settings are changed, disable and reenable satellite mode to apply to new limits)
        - Satellite mode view distance (default 400)
        - Satellite mode max view distance (defualt 400)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 2025-10-28
  Minor Features:
    - Replaced space-age hard requirement with a hidden optional requirement, and an optional requirement for quality
      - Should be compatible now with "Vanilla", i.e. no other mods than this and "base"
    - Now when the "How long will a satellite remain in orbit" setting is set to 0, satellite expiration is disabled
      - i.e. While this setting is 0, satellites will never expire
    - Added default 30 tick or 0.5 seconds delay from a satellite being loaded into a rocket-silo, and the launch being initiated
      - Only applies when the "Automatically launch rockets with satellites" setting is checked
      - This is to allow the default automatic launching of satellites in Vanilla to function when the "Send to orbit automatically" checkbox is checked
        - i.e. launch, but also return space-science packs
      - Added configurable runtime setting for controlling the above delay
    - Vanilla:
      - Added "Track satellites launched for research" runtime setting
        - Whether to track and count satellites launched via the normal means for space-science-packs as being in "orbit"
          - i.e. if manually triggered by a player, or the "Send to orbit automatically" checkbox was checked and triggered the launch
          - Defaults to true
          - Set to false if you only want to consider satellites not launched for science-packs as being in "orbit"
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed potentially getting stuck in satellite mode on version update
    - Fixed some mod setting descriptions not displaying
  Misc:
    - Changed the printing of satellite toggle message from global, to be per force
    - Changed the printing of the 'out of fuel' message for satellites from global, to be per force
      - For existing satellites in orbit, if its force can't be found, it will be defaulted to the "player" force on update
    - Started migration of hard-coded print messages to localised strings
    - Removed space-age mod portal flag in light of the requirement removal
    - Added TheEckelmonster-core-library as a required dependency
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.3
Date: 2025-08-03
  Bug Fixes:
    - Stopped using ~hacky method of getting/passing a planet's magnitude from the Data stage to the Control stage
      - Now using the custom defined 'mod-data' prototype added in version 2.0.60
      -> Aids in compatibility going forward/should be more compatibile out of the box now
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.2
Date: 2025-08-02
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed logic for getting/parsing a planet's magnitude
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.1
Date: 2025-07-31
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed FoW not toggling properly after visiting a surface for the first time
  Misc:
    - Added space-age mod portal flag
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2025-06-29
  Minor Features:
    - Extended how far the player can zoom out in Satellite Mode thanks to player.zoom_limits added in 2.0.46
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed extreme lag/crashing when toggling Satellite Mode over non-placeable tiles
      - i.e. When in Mech Armor over a large body of water, lava, etc..
    - Similarly to the above, when the player dies and their character was over non-placeable tiles, their view should now be appropriately teleported to where the character actually died
      - Was previously looking for the closest placeable position, and teleporting the player's view there
      - Can't seem to find a solution for the ping being misplaced when the character dies though, apologies
  Misc:
    - Changed changelog date format
    - Refactored .lua scripts from "control" directory to "scripts" directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 29. 04. 2025
  Bug fixes:
    - Satellite quality effects are no longer hard-coded and are now programmatically calculated
      Should (hopefully) allow for support of mod added quality levels
      The difference between "Epic" and "Legendary" should now match Vanilla more appropriately
      - Formula now is as follows:
      -> Settings_Service.get_satellite_base_quality_factor()^(prototypes.quality[quality].level)
      - Where satellite_base_quality_factor default is 1.3
      -> Is a configurable runtime setting
      Thanks to sh4dow for the suggestion and pointers!
    - Updated initialization/version validation logic
      Should maintain satellite data on version updates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2025-04-26
  Minor Features:
    - Added Satellite scanning
      - Two modes: queue (default) and stack
      If more than one satellite is in orbit, pressing the satellite shortcut/hotkey ('m' by default) will select the scanning tool
      Click and drag the area to scan
      Make sure to enable scanning via the hotkey, "ctrl + space" by default
      Clear all current and staged scans via hotkey, "ctrl + shift + space" by default
    - Added "Satellite Mode"
      Effectively "Remote View" but it also will reveal new areas of the map
      - Allowed if the number of satellites in orbit of a given planet is >= the satellite launch threshold for the given planet
      - Not allowed when the player/character is in space
    - Major refactoring of almost every file
      - Restructured and standardized directory format
      - Added version system for storage data
      -> Will attempt to migrate storage data from previous versions on update
      - Created schema for storage objects to be based from
      -> Allows for simpler logic and greater maintainability
    - Satellites are now "in orbit" when they actually leave the planet, rather than immediately after launch
    - Updated/added additional console commands, namely:
      /all_seeing.satellites_launched -> Prints the number of satellites currently launched into orbit for each visited planet
  Bug fixes:
    - Fixed satellites returning after being launched to "orbit"
      - Also fixed frame drops if there was no hub to receive the returning satellite
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 2025-04-18
  Bug fixes:
    - Added checks/validations of a planet's magnitude before using it in calculations
      Default magnitude of 1 (same as Nauvis) if no valid magnitude is found for a given planet
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 2025-04-14
  Bug fixes:
    - Added type check before accessing a variable to prevent an error
  Misc:
    - Updated base and space-age version requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2025-03-20
  Minor Features:
    - Figured out a way of basing minimum satellite launch threshold off of the magnitude (size) of a given planet
      Default is 3 (Nauvis); formula is:
      return_val = launch_threshold_setting * planet_magnitude * planet_magnitude
      if (planet_magnitude) < 1 then
      return_val = math.floor(return_val)
      else
      return_val = math.ceil(return_val)
      end
    - Works out to as follows for the vanilla planets:
      Fulgora: magnitude of 0.9 -> 2 satellites
      Nauvis: magnitude of 1 -> 3 satellites
      Aquilo: magnitude of 1 -> 3 satellites
      Gleba: magnitude of 1.1 -> 4 satellites
      Vulcanus: magnitude of 1.5 -> 7 satellites
    - Redid initialization/reinitialization, and then redid it again
    - Added configurable ('None' by default) logging levels
    - Added console commands:
      /all_seeing.init -> Initialize the supporting data structures from scratch, erasing any existing data
      /all_seeing.reinit -> Reinitialize the supporting data structures, making a moderate attempt to maintain existing data
      /all_seeing.print_storage -> Prints the contents or the supportings data structures
    - Support for additional modded planets. Should also properly detect vanilla planets now.
      Tested with Arrakis, and partially with Maraxsis
  Misc:
    - Updated base and space-age version requirements
    - Hotkey message is not displayed until rocket-silo is researched
      Disabling launch requirements will still allow the hotkey to be used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2025-03-19
  Bug fixes:
    - Corrected values/wording for settings and settings descriptions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-03-18
  Minor Features:
    - Satellites now expire after a given amount of time, default 20 minutes
    - Added configurable setting for the duration (in minutes) of a satellite in orbit, default 20 minutes
    - Quality satellites confer a longer life span of ~30% per tier
      normal    -> 20 * 1      = 20
      uncommon  -> 20 * 1.3    = 26
      rare      -> 20 * 1.69   = 33.8
      epic      -> 20 * 2.197  = 43.94
      legendary -> 20 * 2.8561 = 57.122
  Balance Changes:
    - Changed minimum launch threshold to be 3
      i.e. 3 satellites need to be in orbit simultaneously to toggle the FoW
  Misc:
    - Attempted to make minimum satellite launch threshold to be based on the size of the planet it was launched, but couldn't find a way to implement it (yet)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-03-17
  Minor Features:
    - Added satellite back as an item, recipe, and technology unlock (rocket silo research)
    - A rocket with a satellite in its inventory will automatically launch into orbit
    - Added setting to toggle satellite launch requirement
    - Added configurable setting for minimum satellite launch threshold for all planets to disable fog-of-war (0 - 100), default 1
  Misc:
    - Added a thumbnail
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2025-03-15
  Minor Features:
    - Initial release

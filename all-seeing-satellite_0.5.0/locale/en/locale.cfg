all-seeing-satellite-nth-tick=Tick cycle time

all-see-satellite-require-satellites-in-orbit=Require satellites in orbit to toggle the FoW
all-see-satellite-restrict-satellite-scanning=Require satellites in orbit for scanning
all-see-satellite-restrict-satellite-mode=Require satellites in orbit for Satellite Mode

all-seeing-satellite-default-satellite-time-to-live=How long will a satellite remain in orbit

all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold=Satellite launch threshold
all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold-modifier=Satellite launch threshold modifier

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-cooldown-duration=Satellite scan cooldown

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-mode=Satellite scan mode

[mod-setting-description]
all-seeing-satellite-nth-tick=Default of 20\n\ni.e. will try to complete processing over 20 ticks before starting a new cycle\n\nSetting to 0 would cause it to try to process every tick (not recommended)
all-seeing-satellite-default-satellite-time-to-live=Time in minutes that a given satellite will last in orbit. Default of 20 minutes

all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold=Number of satellites required in orbit to toggle FoW or Satellite Mode. 0 to 100, default of 3 for planet with a magnitude of 1 (e.g Nauvis)
all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold-modifier=Ranges from [0-10], default of 1\n\nThe planet's satellite launch threshold is multiplied by this amount

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-cooldown-duration=Number of seconds before a satellite of normal quality can scan again

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-mode=queue: first-in-first-out, starts from the relative origin and works its way outwards to the edge\n\nstack: first-in-last-out, starts from the edge and works its way inward to the relative origin

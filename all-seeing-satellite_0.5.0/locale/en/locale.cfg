# all-seeing-satellite-on-nth-tick=Update the map every Nth tick
all-seeing-satellite-nth-tick=Tick cycle time

all-see-satellite-require-satellites-in-orbit=Require satellites in orbit to toggle the FoW
all-see-satellite-restrict-satellite-scanning=Require satellites in orbit for scanning
all-see-satellite-restrict-satellite-mode=Require satellites in orbit for Satellite Mode

all-seeing-satellite-default-satellite-time-to-live=How long will a satellite remain in orbit

all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold=Satellite launches required to toggle FoW for a planet with magnitude 1, e.g. Nauvis
all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold-modifier=Satellite launch threshold modifier

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-cooldown-duration=Satellite scan cooldown

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-mode=Satellite scan mode

[mod-setting-description]
# all-seeing-satellite-on-nth-tick=Updates once per second by default (Every N ticks - 60 by default)
all-seeing-satellite-nth-tick=Default of 20\n\ni.e. will try to complete processing over 20 ticks before starting a new cycle\n\nSetting to 0 would cause it to try to process every tick (not recommended)
all-seeing-satellite-default-satellite-time-to-live=Time in minutes that a given satellite will last in orbit. Default of 20 minutes

# all-seeing-satellite-debug-level=Default of 'None'. Changing this will determine what level of logging to enable.\nOdrder of precedence: Info > Debug > Warn > Error > None

all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold=0 to 100, default of 3 for planet with a magnitude of 1 (e.g Nauvis)\n\nO efffectively disables needing to launch satellites for the given planet
all-seeing-satellite-global-launch-satellite-threshold-modifier=Ranges from [0-10], default of 1\n\nThe planet's satellite launch threshold is multiplied by this amount

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-cooldown-duration=Number of seconds before a satellite of normal quality can scan again

all-seeing-satellite-satellite-scan-mode=queue: first-in-first-out, starts from the relative origin and works its way outwards to the edge\n\nstack: first-in-last-out, starts from the edge and works its way inward to the relative origin

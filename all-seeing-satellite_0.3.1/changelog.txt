  Bug fixes:
    - Corrected values/wording for settings and settings descriptions

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 18. 03. 2025
  Minor Features:
    - Satellites now expire after a given amount of time, default 20 minutes
    - Added configurable setting for the duration (in minutes) of a satellite in orbit, default 20 minutes
    - Quality satellites confer a longer life span of ~30% per tier
      normal    -> 20 * 1      = 20
      uncommon  -> 20 * 1.3    = 26
      rare      -> 20 * 1.69   = 33.8
      epic      -> 20 * 2.197  = 43.94
      legendary -> 20 * 2.8561 = 57.122
  Balance Changes:
    - Changed minimum launch threshold to be 3
      i.e. 3 satellites need to be in orbit simultaneously to toggle the FoW
  Misc:
    - Attempted to make minimum satellite launch threshold to be based on the size of the planet it was launched, but couldn't find a way to implement it (yet)
